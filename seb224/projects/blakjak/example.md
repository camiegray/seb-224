## Tic Tac Toe 
Project Choice as Title (Tell us which project you're doing!)

## Project Description 

My app is called Tic Tac Toe. It's a game app for players who want to play Tic Tac Toe online. Two players can join an online game and play a round of Tic Tac Toe, with the score being kept automatically and game results displayed at then end of a round -- whichever player won, or in the case of a draw, a tie between the users. Users will have the option to play again. In the future, I'd like to add a feature where one player can play against the computer.

## User Stories

#### MVP Goals

- As a player, I want my game to recognize three ticks in a row so that I know who won.
- As a player, I would like to be informed when the game is over due to a tie.
- As a player, I would like to know whose turn it is so that I don't have to keep track.
- As a player, I would like to be informed with some indication when I mark a game box so that I know my selection worked.
- As a player who requires assistive technologies, I would like accessibility features so that I'm not left out of enjoying the game.
- As a player I would like to be able to restart the game after a win, loss or tie.
- As a player, I want the UI to be engaging and out of the way so that I enjoy the experience of playing the game.\*\*

#### Stretch Goals

- As a player, I would like a victory animation when I win the game, so that I feel good about my victory!
- As a player, I would like to hear an audible sound when I mark a game box so that I know my selection worked.
- As a player, I would like to play this game online so that I don't have to have my challenger sitting next to me.
- As a player who wants to dominate the battlefield I want to become the ultimate tic tac toe tactician so I can beat all of my opponents

## Pseudocode
```js
// 1) Define any variables used to track the state of the game:
//    The players choice
//    The computers choice
//    The match result - win/lose/tie
//    A result message - display who won that round

// 2) Define the required constants:
//    There are only 3 choices a user can make ("rock", "paper", "scissors")
//    We'll need a reference to a DOM element to display messages

// 3) Handle a player clicking a button

// 4) Handle generating random selections for the computer player

// 5) Compare the player choice to the computer choice, and check for a winner

// 6) Render a win/lose/tie message to the player 
//    Include both player and computer selections in the message
//    Clearly indicate who won
```
