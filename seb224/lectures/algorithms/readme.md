# Search Algorithms Exercises

## Overview

In this exercise, you'll practice two different implementations of the binary search algorithm:
* Iterative implementation
* Recursive implementation

Both implementations can be found in the `searches.js` file.

### Instructions

1. **Fork and Clone This Repository**

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate into the project directory and install the necessary dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Complete the Exercises**

   - Open the `searches.js` file.
   - Implement the iterative and recursive versions of the binary search algorithm by adding the necessary parameters and logic.

4. **Check Your Work**

   There are test files for each of these exercises in the "test" folder. Use these test files to check if your search algorithms are implemented correctly.
   To verify your solutions, run the test files by executing:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
