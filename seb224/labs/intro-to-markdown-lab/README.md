In JavaScript, functions are blocks of reusable code. They allow you to bundle functionality, make it more readable, and avoid repetition. Here's a brief tutorial on writing an arrow function in JavaScript.

## 1. Basic syntax

const functionName = (params) => {
  // code to be executed
}

1. **const**: const should be used whenever a function expression is assigned to a variable.
2. **The function name**: The name you choose for the function.
3. **The arrow syntax**: Indicates that this will be a function.
4. **The body**: The statements that make up the function itself. Surrounded by curly braces.

#### *Example:*

```const greet` = (name) => {
  console.log ("Hello, " + name + "!");
}```

> Tip: Functions often perform actions, so naming with a verb can make it clear what the function does. Examples include fetchData( ), calculateArea( ), or printReport( ). 


# 2. Calling a function

To execute the function, you call or invoke it by using its name followed by parentheses.

#### *Example:*

`greet('Alice');` // Outputs: Hello, Alice!

## 3. Return values

Functions can process data input and output a value using the return keyword.

#### *Example:* 

```const addNums `= (numA, numB) => {
  return numA + numB
}```

`const total = addNums(2, 4);`

`console.log(total)` // Expected value: 6
