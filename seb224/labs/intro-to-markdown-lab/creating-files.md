>Working with the command line interface (CLI)  In this guide, we'll cover some basic commands to help you get started: `mkdir`, `take`, and `touch`.

## 1. Creating Directories with `mkdir` and `take`


A **directory** is just a folder that can contain files and other folders. To make one
the `mkdir` or `take` command is used to create a new directory. 


#### `mkdir` (Make Directory)


***Example:*** `mkdir <directory-name>`

>Now `take` does the same exact thing but it also inserts you into the directory you just made saving you from having to `cd` into the directory.

***Example:***
    `take <directory-name>`

Now we have a new directory from either command.

## 2. Creating files with `touch`
 
 The `touch` command creates new files once you have navigated to the directory that you wish to place those files into.


***Example:***
`touch index.html`

 This command creates an empty file named index.html in the current directory.


>You can also create multiple files at once just by inserting a space between the files names as exampled below.

***Example:***
`touch index.html app.js style.css`



> ## **Now You Do:**
