    <div>
      <p><a href="/planets/gas">Gas Giants</a> are composed primarily of hydrogen and helium. 
        They lack a true, solid surfaceâ€”instead, their visible layers are made up of swirling, dynamic gases and liquids. Their massive size and gravitational influence have allowed them to accumulate a rich system of moons, 
        showcasing a dramatically different environment from their rocky cousins.</p></div>
        <div>
      <p><a href="/planets/rocky">Rocky Planets</a> consists of terrestrial, rocky worlds that are built from stone and metals. 
        These bodies boast solid, tangible surfaces that invite exploration and even the possibility of standing on them. 
        They reside closer to the Sun, are comparatively smaller, and typically host only a handful of moons.</p>
