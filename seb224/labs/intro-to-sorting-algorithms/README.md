## Basic Sorting Algorithms Exercises

### Instructions

1. **Fork and Clone This Repository**

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate into the project directory and install the necessary dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Complete the Exercises**

   - Open the `bubble-sort.js` and `insertion-sort.js` files.
   - Implement the required sorting algorithms by adding the necessary parameters and logic.

4. **Check Your Work**

   There are test files for each of these exercises with the same name. Use these test files to check if your sorting algorithms are implemented correctly.
   To verify your solutions, run the test files by executing:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
